    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>Mzamomtsha Primary School, nestled between Khayelitsha Township and Umfuleni Township in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, has been a pillar of education since its establishment. Under the leadership of Headmaster Mr. Simphiwe Khuze since 2007, our school has served the Drift Sands community with dedication and commitment.

        Originally designed for grades 1 to 7, our school has adapted to the rapid population growth by enrolling students up to grade 12. As Drift Sands evolved from an informal settlement into a thriving township, Mzamomtsha Primary School played a vital role in supporting the local community.
        
        Despite facing challenges such as limited classroom space, a lack of online presence, and staffing constraints, we remain steadfast in our mission to provide quality education to our 700 learners. With a team of 20 dedicated teachers, we strive to create an environment where every student can learn, grow, and succeed.
        
        At Mzamomtsha Primary School, we are committed to shaping the future of our community by empowering our students with the knowledge and skills they need to thrive in an ever-changing world. Join us on our journey of education and transformation.
